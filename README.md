# 1. LLM Ensemble and Taxonomy

## 1.1 LLM Ensemble
**Paper Abstract**:

LLM Ensemble---which involves the comprehensive use of multiple large language models (LLMs), each aimed at handling user queries during the downstream inference, to benefit from their individual strengths---has gained substantial attention recently. 
The widespread availability of LLMs, coupled with their varying strengths and out-of-the-box usability, has profoundly advanced the field of LLM Ensemble. 
This paper presents the first systematic review of recent developments in LLM Ensemble. 
First, we introduce our taxonomy of LLM Ensemble and discuss several related research problems. 
Then, we provide a more in-depth classification of methods under the broad categories of ``ensemble-before-inference, ensemble-during-inference, ensemble-after-inference'', and review all relevant methods. Finally, we introduce related benchmarks and applications, summarize existing studies, and suggest several future research directions. 
A curated list of papers  on LLM Ensemble is available at https://github.com/junchenzhi/Awesome-LLM-Ensemble.

## 1.2 Taxonomy

**Figure 1:  Illustration of LLM Ensemble Taxonomy.** (Note that for *(b) ensemble-during-inference* paradigm, there is also a *process-level ensemble* approach that we have not represented in the figure, mainly because that this approach is instantiated by a single method.)

**Figure 2: Taxonomy of All LLM Ensemble Methods.**
</div>





- ***(a) Ensemble before inference.***  
In essence, this approach employs a routing algorithm prior to LLM inference to allocate a specific query to the most suitable model, allowing the selected model that is specialized for the query and typically more cost-efficient inference to perform the task.
 Existing methods can be classified into two categories, depending on whether the router necessitates the use of pre-customized data for pre-training:   
  - ***(a1) Pre-training router;***
  - ***(a2) Non pre-training router.***




- ***(b) Ensemble during inference.***  
As the most granular form of ensemble among the three broad categories, this type of approach encompasses: 
  - ***(b1) Token-level ensemble*** methods, which integrate the token-level outputs of multiple models at the finest granularity of decoding;
  - ***(b2) Span-level ensemble*** methods, which conduct ensemble at the level of a sequence fragment (e.g., a span of four words); 
  - ***(b3) Process-level ensemble*** methods, which select the optimal reasoning process step-by-step within the reasoning chain for a given complex reasoning task. 
Note that for these ensemble-during-inference methods, the aggregated text segments will be concatenated with the previous text and fed again to models.



- ***(c) Ensemble after inference.***  
These methods can be classified into two categories:
  - ***(c1) Non cascade*** methods, which perform ensemble using multiple complete responses contributed from all LLM candidates;
  - ***(c2) Cascade*** methods, which consider both performance and inference costs, progressively reasoning through a chain of LLM candidates largely sorted by model size to find the most suitable inference response.
